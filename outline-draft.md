# This is just a list of topics. They are not in order within the sections.
# This is just a list of topics. They do not indicate the pedagogical technique

# For each section there are only 3 goals
1. Make sure people have the stuff installed and working
2. Gain familiarity and comfort with the topic
3. Learn how to get help, 1st alone, then to a person if needed

# Right now we just want to know if we have the right list of topics.



## Computers!
1. operating system
2. shell (bash)
3. version control (git/github)
4. getting terminal on windows
5. text editor v word processor (VS Code)
6. "#" is a comment in BASH,R,Python
7. pwd, ls, cd, history (they can learn the rest on their own)
8. intro questions- not to answer but to set the framing and plant seeds
  * When should I terminal/script/program/text editor/IDE
  * When should I use R v Python
  * Does this fit in memory/ Do I need more than my laptop?
  * It's ok to freeze and not know what to do, that means you are about to learn. Feel the burn
  * Which ml tool is  right for the job
  * How  do I translate a research question into a data question? How to I translate a data  answer to a research answer?

## Putting it all togegther (aka the fun part)
1. reading in data
2. munging data
3. plotting data
4. presenting dat
This is language agnostic. The prompt works for R and Python. We give examples in both languages.
The goal of this part is to open the world to how a data scientist operates and thinks.
