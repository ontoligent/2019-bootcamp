  * Does this fit in memory/ Do I need more than my laptop?
  * It's ok to freeze and not know what to do, that means you are about to learn. Feel the burn

## July 2, PM: Thinking like a data scientist (aka Putting it all togegther (aka the fun part))
This is language agnostic. The prompt works for R and Python. We give examples in both languages.
The goal of this part is to open the world to how a data scientist operates and thinks.

1. reading in data
2. munging data
3. plotting data
4. presenting data
